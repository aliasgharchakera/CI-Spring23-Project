# CI-Spring23-Project

## Introduction
### We have used Evolutionary Algorithm to attempt to optimize the number of artificial lights in a room. The goal is to minimize the number of lights while maintaining a certain level of illumination. The illumination is calculated using the inverse square law. The fitness function incorporates both the number of lights and the number of lit tiles.
